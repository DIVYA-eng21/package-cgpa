# 🎓 Placement Package Prediction Based on CGPA

This machine learning project aims to predict a student's **placement package** based on their **CGPA** using various regression models. The goal is to help understand how academic performance can impact salary outcomes during campus placements.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

- The dataset contains features like:
  - `CGPA`: Cumulative Grade Point Average
  - `Package`: Placement salary offered (in LPA)

You can find the dataset in this repo under the name: `placement_dataset.csv`.

## 🧠 Models Implemented

1. **Linear Regression**  
2. **Decision Tree Regressor**
3. **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**
4. **Voting Regressor**  
   – Combines the predictions of all three models above for better performance.

## ✅ Model Evaluation

- **Cross-Validation** is used to evaluate model robustness.
- Performance metrics:
  - `R² Score`
  - `Mean Squared Error (MSE)`
  - `Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)`
